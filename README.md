# vr-createathon
A group project by 4 developer/designers, as a first forray into Virtual Reality. None of us have explored any of these VR concepts or technologies before, so this is our first experience with everything, done in a few hours at a createathon event.

We created a lovely low-poly landscape in pastel colors in Unity, with asset creation in Blender. It's not perfect, but we learned a lot, and are eager to create again!
